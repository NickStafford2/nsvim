# NSVim

Just my personal configuration. These neovim configurations are no joke. I even have one of my own plugins loaded here.

# Packages to consider

- add keyboard visual map
- add emmet
- strongly consider flash.nvim or some other way to properly select tags in jsx
- decide what I want to do with terminal

- figure out spell check.
- figure out why cursor disapears.
- add an email section
